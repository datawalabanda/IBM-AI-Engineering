Mastering the fundamentals of Machine learning and Deep Learning


## ðŸŽ“ About My Learning Journey

AI is expected to grow by **36.6% by 2030 (Forbes)**, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of this transformation.  
I am currently pursuing the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**, which is designed for data scientists, machine learning engineers, software engineers, and other technical specialists who want to become job-ready as AI engineers.  

During this program, Iâ€™m learning how to **build, train, and deploy deep learning architectures**, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, autoencoders, and generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs).  

Iâ€™m also strengthening my foundation in **machine learning and deep learning concepts**â€”from supervised to unsupervised learningâ€”using **Python**. Along the way, Iâ€™m applying powerful libraries like **SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow** to solve real-world problems in **computer vision, image and video processing, NLP, text analytics, and recommender systems**.  

Another exciting part of my journey is building **Generative AI applications** with **LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using frameworks like **Hugging Face** and **LangChain**.  

Through hands-on labs and projects, Iâ€™m gaining **practical, job-ready skills** that will help me build a strong portfolio and stand out to employers. ðŸš€
